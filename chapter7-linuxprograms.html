<h2 id="linux-gaming"><a class="header" href="#linux-gaming">Linux Gaming</a></h2>
<p>Linux gaming has come a long way in recent years, with many popular games now available natively on the platform. Additionally, tools like Proton (a compatibility layer for running Windows games on Linux) and Lutris (a gaming platform for managing games from various sources) have made it easier to play games on Linux. If you want to play a lot of games on Linux and do not want to do much configuration, I recommend using either Bazzite or Nobara Linux, which are both gaming-focused distributions that come pre-configured with the necessary tools and drivers for gaming. Starting from a fresh blank distribution like Debian or Arch Linux can be challenging for gaming, as you will need to manually install and configure various components to get games running smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-wine-and-proton"><a class="header" href="#understanding-wine-and-proton">Understanding WINE and Proton</a></h3>
<p>WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator) is a compatibility layer that allows you to run Windows applications on Linux. It translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls, enabling you to run many Windows applications without needing a full Windows installation. Proton is a modified version of WINE developed by Valve, specifically designed to run Windows games on Linux through the Steam platform. It includes additional libraries and optimizations to improve game compatibility and performance.
While WINE and Proton can run many Windows applications and games, they are not perfect solutions. Some applications may not work correctly or may require additional configuration to run smoothly. It is essential to check compatibility reports on sites like <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">ProtonDB</a> to see if a specific game or application is supported and to find any necessary tweaks or workarounds.</p>
<p>Lutris is a front-end for managing games on Linux, providing a user-friendly interface for installing and launching games from various sources, including Steam, GOG, and Battle.net. It supports WINE and Proton, allowing you to run Windows games on Linux with ease. Lutris also provides scripts for installing specific games, which can simplify the setup process.</p>
<p>Heroic Games Launcher is an open-source game launcher for the Epic Games Store that allows you to install and play Epic Games on Linux. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports various game configurations, making it easier to manage your Epic Games library on Linux.</p>
<p>Bottles is a front-end for WINE that simplifies the process of running Windows applications on Linux. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing WINE prefixes and configurations, making it easier to run Windows games and applications without needing extensive knowledge of WINE.</p>
<h4 id="wine-usage"><a class="header" href="#wine-usage">WINE Usage</a></h4>
<p>WINE is a powerful tool for running Windows applications on Linux, but it can be complex to set up and use effectively. Here are some tips for using WINE:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation</strong>: Install WINE using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install wine
</code></pre>
<p>On Arch Linux, you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo pacman -S wine
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong>: After installing WINE, you can run <code>winecfg</code> in the terminal to configure WINE settings. This will create a default WINE prefix in your home directory (<code>~/.wine</code>) and allow you to set various options, such as the Windows version to emulate, graphics settings, and audio configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Installing Windows Applications</strong>: To install a Windows application using WINE, you can run the installer executable with the <code>wine</code> command. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wine setup.exe
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>setup.exe</code> with the actual name of the installer file. WINE will create a virtual C: drive in your WINE prefix, where the application will be installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Running Windows Applications</strong>: After installation, you can run the application using WINE by executing the application's executable file. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wine /path/to/application.exe
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>/path/to/application.exe</code> with the actual path to the application's executable file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing WINE Prefixes</strong>: WINE uses a concept called "prefixes" to manage different environments for running Windows applications. By default, WINE uses the <code>~/.wine</code> directory as its prefix. You can create additional prefixes by setting the <code>WINEPREFIX</code> environment variable before running WINE commands. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">WINEPREFIX="/path/to/custom/prefix" wine /path/to/application.exe
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to maintain separate configurations and installations for different applications, which can be useful for managing dependencies and settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Winetricks</strong>: Winetricks is a script that helps you install various Windows libraries and components in your WINE prefix. It can be useful for installing .NET Framework, DirectX, and other dependencies required by certain applications. You can install Winetricks using your package manager or download it from the <a href="https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks">Winetricks GitHub repository</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wine prefixes can get complicated when adding dotnet and other features with winetricks. Unlike Windows, you cannot UNINSTALL dotnet from a WINE prefix, so it is best to create a new prefix for each application that requires different versions of dotnet or other libraries. This way, you can avoid conflicts and ensure that each application has the correct environment to run smoothly. Once you get the application running, do NOT change the WINE prefix or add/remove libraries, as this can break the application. If you need to make changes, create a new prefix and set it up again. This involves deleting the old prefix and starting fresh, but it is the best way to ensure that your applications run smoothly without conflicts.</p>
<h4 id="proton-usage"><a class="header" href="#proton-usage">Proton Usage</a></h4>
<p>Proton is a compatibility layer developed by Valve that allows you to run Windows games on Linux through the Steam platform. It is built on top of WINE and includes additional libraries and optimizations to improve game compatibility and performance. Here are some tips for using Proton:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation</strong>:
Proton is integrated into the Steam client, so you do not need to install it separately.
Make sure you have the latest version of Steam installed on your Linux system. You can install Steam using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install steam
</code></pre>
<p>On Arch Linux, you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo pacman -S steam
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enabling Proton for all games</strong>:
To enable Proton for all games, open the Steam client, go to "Settings," then "Steam Play." Check the box for "Enable Steam Play for all other titles" and select the desired Proton version from the dropdown menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Installing Proton GE</strong>:
Proton GE (Glorious Eggroll) is a community-maintained version of Proton that includes additional patches and optimizations for specific games. To install Proton GE, you can download it from the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases">Proton GE GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>After downloading, extract the contents to your Steam directory, typically located at <code>~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/</code>. If the <code>compatibilitytools.d</code> directory does not exist, you can create it.
Once extracted, restart the Steam client, and you should see Proton GE listed as an available compatibility tool in the Steam Play settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For updating Proton GE, I'd recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/ProtonUp/ProtonUp-Qt">ProtonUp-Qt</a> tool, which provides a user-friendly interface for managing and updating Proton GE installations OR if using the terminal you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">protonup -u
</code></pre>
